How to contribute
=================

Setting up for hacking
======================

The Github route:

    1. Create an account on Github
    2. Go to https://github.com/willkg/victor and fork the project
    3. Clone your fork
    4. Create a virtual environment
    5. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in your virtual environment

The non-Github route:

    1. Run ``git clone https://github.com/willkg/victor``
    2. Create a virtual environment
    3. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in your virtual environment


What to work on
===============

Feel free to work on any issue in the issue tracker that isn't assigned
to someone else.

Before you work on something, at least leave a comment in the issue
that you plan to work on it and what you're planning to do. Sometimes
it's a good idea to wait for a response in case that issue isn't updated
and it's not something that should get worked on.


Submitting changes
==================

The Github route:

    1. Create a new branch
    2. Put your changes in that branch
    3. Create a pull request for your branch
    4. In the pull request description, explain what you did and why
       and any special considerations that should be taken when
       testing.

The non-Github route:

    1. Create a new branch
    2. Put your changes in that branch
    3. Run::

           git format-patch --stdout <remote>/master > issue_<number>.patch

       and send me an email with the attached file.
